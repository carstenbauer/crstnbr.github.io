<p>Welcome to my <a href="https://github.com/crstnbr">github repository</a>!</p>
<p>I am in the process of writing my <a href="http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~broecker">PhD thesis</a> in theoretical physics at the University of Cologne. In the following repositories, I publish some of the codes that I have used during that time. I made an effort to polish them a bit and add some commentary where necessary. If not mentioned otherwise, they are published under the GPL license.</p>
<p>The main focus of my work is the development of tools to study so-called interacting, quantum many-body systems, in particular quantum Monte Carlo. I developed most of these simulations in C(++) with analysis scripts written in Python until about two years ago when I made the switch to using Julia and Python for production codes as well. The reason is simply that these languages allow for much faster prototyping while the decrease in speed is often negligible, especially with Julia and Cython. Most of the codes I publish are thus in these two languages, which should make them accessible also for beginners in the field. </p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding the code or the research performed with it!</p>
